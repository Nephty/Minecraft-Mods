Build : 1.16.5 0.0.6 - Mon Jun 14 17:24:46 GMT 2021 Nephty : Enchanted flowers now have a random chance of breaking upon harvesting pollen. The random chance distribution is not uniform, and the maximum number of harvests before breaking the flower is 10. Also, the random chance is not unique to each flower. This means that harvesting multiple flowers once will be the same as harvesting the same flower multiple times, in terms of breaking probabilities. The harvester now has a durability of 220 and using the right click to move pollen into the harvester or out from it has a 1 in 4 chance of damaging the item. Right clicking a flower to harvest pollen will always damage the item. Modified the texture of the pollen to make it more brown-ish. Added golden pollen, which can be crafted with 8 pollen and 1 gold ingot.
